                <p class="fs-5">Student debt is a form of debt that is owed by an attending, formerly withdrawn, or graduated student to a lending institution, or to a financial institution. Soaring college costs and pressure to compete in the job marketplace are big factors for student loan debt. Student loans are the most common form of educational debt, followed by credit cards and other types of credit.
                    <br><br><strong>Student loan borrowers in the United States owe a collective nearly $1.75 trillion in federal and private student loan debt</strong> as of August 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Expecting an 18 to 19-year-old coming straight out of high school to understand and manage a large abundance of money with no previous experience is lucrative.

                        Signs of trouble with student borrowing began to appear by the late 1980s. In 1986, parents and students had incurred nearly $10 billion in federal student loans. All these years and it seems there has never been a <strong>TRUE</strong> solution to this ongoing problem; A problem that affects the futures of these individuals mentally & financially.

                    According to a CNBC report, “85 percent of student loan borrowers say difficulty in saving has delayed their ability to buy a house,” and other research indicates that “Those with student loan debt also are less likely to have taken out car loans. They have worse credit scores. They appear to be more likely to be living with their parents." Defaults and delinquencies are also more common with student loan debt than just about any other kind. While credit card default rates have dropped under 10 percent thanks to stricter borrowing guidelines, the rate of student loans in “serious delinquency” has gone up to 11.5 percent.

                <p class="cp-5 fs-5">
                    Students from low-income backgrounds still face the greatest struggle when it comes to earning college degrees. Unstable home lives, lower-quality high schools and other frequent corollaries of low-income neighborhoods present plenty of obstacles even before loan debt becomes an issue.<br><br>For students from middle-class backgrounds, the road to a degree seems easier. Their families often have money saved; their schools and support systems tend to prepare them well for the next step. Nevertheless, finances are still a roadblock, and middle-class students actually shoulder more student loan debt than anyone after graduating.
