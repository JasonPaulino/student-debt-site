                            <p>Broad forgiveness — could help the most vulnerable borrowers: those who never graduated and lack the bigger paychecks that typically come with a degree to pay off the debt they acquired along the way.</p>
                            <p>They agree future debt accumulation must be addressed.</p>

                            <p>Making zero interest permanent or lowering interest on existing debt could help borrowers pay off their debt without growing the principal</p>

                            <p>Tuition-free college at the associate’s degree level, could particularly benefit low-income students who otherwise wouldn’t attend college and could reduce overall borrowing</p>
                            <p>However, experts agree tuition-free programs will still require borrowers to take on debt to cover living expenses — on or off campus.</p>

                        <h2>How Budgeting After College Can Help Repay Student Loans</h2>
                        <p class="lead my-4">Budgeting is a two-step process that tells you volumes about your ability to manage money.</p>
                        <p class="lead"> The first step is to determine monthly income from all sources. In college, that could mean money from a job, your parents, and financial aid. After college, that list usually goes down to your job and whatever help your parents might offer.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Step two is to list expenses. There are fixed expenses like rent, phone/cable bill, food, and maybe a car loan.</p>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Some options to lighten the spending of disposable income:
                        </h3>
                        <ul class="lead">
                            <li>Live Like A College Kid: Some aspects of college life are worth keeping, at least in the short term. Living with roommates to share in the rent and expenses.
                            </li>
                            <li>Smart Clothing: Don't waste your first paycheck on expensive sneakers or clothing.</li>
                            <li>Learn To Cook: Eating out destroys budgets. Learn a few easy recipes and eat in.
                            </li>
                            <li>Don't Drive Alone: That means carpooling. Or it could mean public transportation. Or if you live in a small city that could mean walking.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
